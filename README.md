# COSI123A-HW5-Gene-Classifier-Model
Use the training set to build a classifier (limited to what we have covered in our class), and apply it to the test set and submit your prediction results in a text file (one prediction per line).  The order of your predictions should be the same to the order of test samples.  In addition, you should also submit a written report explaining what you do to get your results, which should have enough details for readers to reproduce your results.
